 **Steps For making Power BI Dashboard**
 
1. Data Import & Cleaning
Loaded amazon.csv into Power BI
Cleaned data by removing null/invalid rows (e.g., blank categories, 0 pricing)
Updated column types: Prices (Decimal), Ratings & Review Count (Numeric)

2. Data Transformation
Added calculated column for discount percentage:
discount_percentage = (actual_price - discounted_price) / actual_price * 100

3. Dashboard Page 1: Overview
KPI Cards: Total Products, Avg Rating, Avg Discount, Total Reviews
Bar Chart: Top 10 Products by Rating Count
Donut Chart: Product Count by Category
Scatter Chart: Discount % vs Rating
